# About
This is bot only can run on Playok website (URL: www.playok.com)
This program can Swap, Swap2, Standard rule and play at the middle game (continue the game you play). If you have some error, contact me, I will help you. My email: nguyencongminh050@gmail.
Thanks for using my program.
# Requirements
- OpenCV 4.1.0.25
- Pynput
- Pyautogui
- Keyboard
# How to use:
Ctrl+Shift+X: The program will automatically compute the turn.

Alt+S : Stop and Restart

Note:
- Board size have to be full screen (Look image if you have error. Try it first if still have error, report me.)
- In this new version, you need to press hotkey after the opponent or you put the opening, not before the opening like the older one.
Ex: o8 a8 o7 (3 moves of opening) [press hotkey] -> ... bot will play, you don't need to choose black or white anymore
or Swap2 rule: o8 o7 l3 l9 m2 (5 moves of opening) [press hotkey] ->..  will play, you don't need to choose black or white anymore
